			<p>NURSE</p>
  			<p><q>Would God no Argo e'er had winged the seas<br>
  To Colchis through the blue Sympl&#234;gades:<br>
  No shaft of riven pine in P&#234;lion's glen<br>
  Shaped that first oar-blade in the hands of men<br>
  Valiant, who won, to save King Pelias' vow,<br>
  The fleece All-golden! Never then, I trow,<br>
  Mine own princess, her spirit wounded sore<br>
  With love of Jason, to the encastled shore<br>
  Had sailed of old I&#244;lcos: never wrought<br>
  The daughters of King Pelias, knowing not,<br>
  To spill their father's life: nor fled in fear,<br>
  Hunted for that fierce sin, to Corinth here<br>
  With Jason and her babes. This folk at need<br>
  Stood friend to her, and she in word and deed<br>
  Served alway Jason. Surely this doth bind,<br>
  Through all ill days, the hurts of humankind,<br>
  When man and woman in one music move.<br>
      But now, the world is angry, and true love<br>
  Sick as with poison. Jason doth forsake<br>
  My mistress and his own two sons, to make<br>
  His couch in a king's chamber. He must wed:<br>
  Wed with this Creon's child, who now is head<br>
  And chief of Corinth. Wherefore sore betrayed<br>
  Medea calleth up the oath they made,<br>
  They two, and wakes the clasp&#232;d hands again,<br>
  The troth surpassing speech, and cries amain<br>
  On God in heaven to mark the end, and how<br>
  Jason hath paid his debt.<br>
                                             All fasting now<br>
  And cold, her body yielded up to pain,<br>
  Her days a waste of weeping, she hath lain,<br>
  Since first she knew that he was false. Her eyes<br>
  Are lifted not; and all her visage lies<br>
  In the dust. If friends will speak, she hears no more<br>
  Than some dead rock or wave that beats the shore:<br>
  Only the white throat in a sudden shame<br>
  May writhe, and all alone she moans the name<br>
  Of father, and land, and home, forsook that day<br>
  For this man's sake, who casteth her away.<br>
  Not to be quite shut out from home . . . alas,<br>
  She knoweth now how rare a thing that was!<br>
  Methinks she hath a dread, not joy, to see<br>
  Her children near. 'Tis this that maketh me<br>
  Most tremble, lest she do I know not what.<br>
  Her heart is no light thing, and useth not<br>
  To brook much wrong. I know that woman, aye,<br>
  And dread her! Will she creep alone to die<br>
  Bleeding in that old room, where still is laid<br>
  Lord Jason's bed? She hath for that a blade<br>
  Made keen. Or slay the bridegroom and the king,<br>
  And win herself God knows what direr thing?<br>
 'Tis a fell spirit. Few, I ween, shall stir<br>
  Her hate unscathed, or lightly humble her.<br>
      Ha! 'Tis the children from their games again,<br>
  Rested and gay; and all their mother's pain<br>
  Forgotten! Young lives ever turn from gloom!</q></p>
  
		<div id="Medea to the women of Corinth">
			<p>MEDEA</p>
			<p><q>Women of Corinth, I am come to show<br>
My face, lest ye despise me. For I know<br>
Some heads stand high and fail not, even at night<br>
Alone&#8213;far less like this, in all men's sight:<br>
And we, who study not our wayfarings<br>
But feel and cry&#8213;Oh we are drifting things,<br>
And evil! For what truth is in men's eyes,<br>
Which search no heart, but in a flash despise<br>
A strange face, shuddering back from one that ne'er<br>
Hath wronged them? . . . Sure, far-comers anywhere,<br>
I know, must bow them and be gentle. Nay,<br>
A Greek himself men praise not, who alway<br>
Should seek his own will recking not. . . . But I&#8213;<br>
This thing undreamed of, sudden from on high,<br>
Hath sapped my soul: I dazzle where I stand,<br>
The cup of all life shattered in my hand,<br>
Longing to die&#8213;O friends! He, even he,<br>
Whom to know well was all the world to me,<br>
The man I loved, hath proved most evil.&#8213;Oh,<br>
Of all things upon earth that bleed and grow,<br>
A herb most bruised is woman. We must pay<br>
Our store of gold, hoarded for that one day,<br>
To buy us some man's love; and lo, they bring<br>
A master of our flesh! There comes the sting<br>
Of the whole shame. And then the jeopardy,<br>
For good or ill, what shall that master be;<br>
Reject she cannot: and if he but stays<br>
His suit, 'tis shame on all that woman's days.<br>
So thrown amid new laws, new places, why,<br>
'Tis magic she must have, or prophecy&#8213;<br>
Home never taught her that&#8213;how best to guide<br>
Toward peace this thing that sleepeth at her side.<br>
And she who, labouring long, shall find some way<br>
Whereby her lord may bear with her, nor fray<br>
His yoke too fiercely, blessed is the breath<br>
That woman draws! Else, let her pray for death.<br>
Her lord, if he be wearied of the face<br>
Withindoors, gets him forth; some merrier place<br>
Will ease his heart: but she waits on, her whole<br>
Vision enchain&#232;d on a single soul.<br>
And then, forsooth, 'tis they that face the call<br>
Of war, while we sit sheltered, hid from all<br>
Peril!&#8213;False mocking! Sooner would I stand<br>
Three times to face their battles, shield in hand,<br>
Than bear one child.<br>
                                    But peace! There cannot be<br>
Ever the same tale told of thee and me.<br>
Thou hast this city, and thy father's home,<br>
And joy of friends, and hope in days to come:<br>
But I, being citiless, am cast aside<br>
By him that wedded me, a savage bride<br>
Won in far seas and left&#8213;no mother near,<br>
No brother, not one kinsman anywhere<br>
For harbour in this storm. Therefore of thee<br>
I ask one thing. If chance yet ope to me<br>
Some path, if even now my hand can win<br>
Strength to requite this Jason for his sin,<br>
Betray me not! Oh, in all things but this,<br>
I know how full of fears a woman is,<br>
And faint at need, and shrinking from the light<br>
Of battle: but once spoil her of her right<br>
In man's love, and there moves, I warn thee well,<br>
No bloodier spirit between heaven and hell.</q></p>

		<div id="Medea talks about what happened">
		<p>MEDEA</p>
		<p><q>Evil, most evil! . . . since thou grantest me<br>
That comfort, the worst weapon left me now<br>
To smite a coward. . . . Thou comest to me, thou,<br>
Mine enemy! (Turning to the Chorus.) Oh, say, how call ye this,<br>
To face, and smile, the comrade whom his kiss<br>
Betrayed? Scorn? Insult? Courage? None of these:<br>
'Tis but of all man's inward sicknesses<br>
The vilest, that he knoweth not of shame<br>
Nor pity! Yet I praise him that he came . . .<br>
To me it shall bring comfort, once to clear<br>
My heart on thee, and thou shalt wince to hear.<br>
    I will begin with that, 'twixt me and thee,<br>
That first befell. I saved thee. I saved thee&#8213;<br>
Let thine own Greeks be witness, every one<br>
That sailed on Argo&#8213;saved thee, sent alone<br>
To yoke with yokes the bulls of fiery breath,<br>
And sow that Acre of the Lords of Death;<br>
And mine own ancient Serpent, who did keep<br>
The Golden Fleece, the eyes that knew not sleep,<br>
And shining coils, him also did I smite<br>
Dead for thy sake, and lifted up the light<br>
That bade thee live. Myself, uncounsell&#232;d,<br>
Stole forth from father and from home, and fled<br>
Where dark I&#244;lcos under Pelion lies,<br>
With thee&#8213;Oh, single-hearted more than wise!<br>
I murdered Pelias, yea, in agony,<br>
By his own daughters' hands, for sake of thee;<br>
I swept their house like War.&#8213;And hast thou then<br>
Accepted all&#8213;O evil yet again!&#8213;<br>
And cast me off and taken thee for bride<br>
Another? And with children at thy side!<br>
One could forgive a childless man. But no:<br>
I have borne thee children . . .<br>
                                     Is sworn faith so low<br>
And weak a thing? I understand it not.<br>
Are the old gods dead? Are the old laws forgot,<br>
And new laws made? Since not my passioning,<br>
But thine own heart, doth cry thee for a thing<br>
Forsworn.

               <i>[She catches sight of her own hand which she has
                      thrown out to denounce him.</i><br>
                 Poor, poor right hand of mine, whom he<br>
Did cling to, and these knees, so cravingly,<br>
We are unclean, thou and I; we have caught the stain<br>
Of bad men's flesh . . . and dreamed our dreams in vain.<br>
    Thou comest to befriend me? Give me, then,<br>
Thy counsel. 'Tis not that I dream again<br>
For good from thee: but, questioned, thou wilt show<br>
The viler. Say: now whither shall I go?<br>
Back to my father? Him I did betray,<br>
And all his land, when we two fled away.<br>
To those poor Peliad maids? For them 'twere good<br>
To take me in, who spilled their father's blood. . . .<br>
Aye, so my whole life stands! There were at home<br>
Who loved me well: to them I am become<br>
A curse. And the first friends who sheltered me,<br>
Whom most I should have spared, to pleasure thee<br>
I have turned to foes. Oh, therefore hast thou laid<br>
My crown upon me, blest of many a maid<br>
In Hellas, now I have won what all did crave,<br>
Thee, the world-wondered lover and the brave;<br>
Who this day looks and sees me banished, thrown<br>
Away with these two babes, all, all, alone . . .<br>
Oh, merry mocking when the lamps are red:<br>
"Where go the bridegroom's babes to beg their bread<br>
In exile, and the woman who gave all<br>
To save him?"<br>
                       O great God, shall gold withal<br>
Bear thy clear mark, to sift the base and fine,<br>
And o'er man's living visage runs no sign<br>
To show the lie within, ere all too late?</q></p>
