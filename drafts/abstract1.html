<p>Medea is certainly one of the most interesting characters.</p>
<p>Her magical powers and the terrible act of filicide, have made her an interesting subject for many writers and artists, creating on one side a wild woman, justified by her own beliefs and culture in the terrible acts that she is pushed to, and on the other a scorned lover who did everything in her power to help a man that never rewarded her.</p>
<p>Her story is many times linked with the one of the Argonauts, as Ovid does in his <q>Metamorphoses</q></p>
<p> it starts with a blooming and forbidden romance between her and Jason, the hero who came to Medea's kingdom to steal its most valued possession, the infamous golden veil.</p>
<p>Apollonius Rhodium describes, instead, in an incredible show of psychological knowledge and expression, Medea's slow descent in her love for Jason, showcasing the woman’s feelings with an amazing precision and attention.</p>
<p>Medea, through her knowledge of magic, helps her lover first in the conquest of the golden veil, offering the hero suggestions about how to win every trial imposed by her father, and then in the escape from Colchis, where the sorceress reveals her bloodthirsty and determinate nature, killing her brother to escape her father’s clutches.</p>
<p>Still her love for Jason doesn't end with an <i>happy ending</i>.</p>
<p>After having found shelter in Corinth, Medea, Jason, and they children are hosted by the land's rightful king, Creon, who aims to marry off his own daughter to the infamous hero</p>">
<p>Jason happily accepts to marry his host’s daughter, fascinated by the allure of power and the possibility to have a younger and noble wife.</p>
<p>Medea isn’t blind to her lovers’s intentions and threads carefully her revenge, killing the children she generated with Jason after having gifted the young Glauce, Jason’s soon-to-be-wife and princess of Corinth, a poisoned dress, and a golden crown, effectively murdering her as well, alongside her father who had just wanted to help his daughter.</p>
<p>After having alienated herself from everyone she loved and killed those who were the closest to her, Medea runs away on the Sun’s chariot, to travel to Athens and later back to the Colchis, to reunite with her father.</p>
<p>All of this is described in Euripides' tragedy by the same name as the infamous sorceress, meanwhile, Ovid represents a meet</p>
<p>The three authors we suggest for our repertory showcase three different perspectives on this mysterious woman, which we hope will further encourage your interest in such an interesting and magical figure.</p>
