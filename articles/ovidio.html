                        ploughing through

                        They had visited <span class="charmortal" about="Phineus">Phineus</span>, king of Thracian

                        the daughter of the king, conceived an
                        overwhelming passion for <span class="charmortal" about="Jason">Jason</span>. She fought
                        against

                        overcome desire, she debated with herself.
                    </p>
                    <p><q><span class="charmortal" about="Medea">Medea</span>, you struggle in vain: some god, I do not
                            know which, opposes you. I wonder if this,
                            or
                            something, like this, is what people indeed call love? Or why would the tasks my father
                            demands of <span class="charmortal" about="Jason">Jason</span> seem so hard? They are more
                            than hard! Why am I afraid of his death,
                            when I
                            have scarcely seen him? What is the cause of all this fear? Quench, if you can, unhappy
                            girl, these flames that you feel in your virgin heart! If I could, I would be wiser! But
                            a
                            strange power draws me to him against my will. Love urges one thing: reason another. I
                            see,
                            and I desire the better: I follow the worse. Why do you burn for a stranger, royal
                            virgin,
                            and dream of marriage in an alien land? This earth can also give you what you can love.
                            Whether he lives or dies, is in the hands of the gods. Let him live! I can pray for this
                            even if I may not love him: what is <span class="charmortal" about="Jason">Jason</span>
                            guilty of? Who, but the heartless, would not
                            be
                            touched by <span class="charmortal" about="Jason">Jason</span>&apos;s youth, and birth, and
                            courage? Who, though the other qualities
                            were
                            absent, could not be stirred by his beauty?</p>
                    <p>He has stirred my heart, indeed. And unless I offer my help, he will feel the fiery breath of
                        the
                        bronze-footed bulls; have to meet that enemy, sprung from the soil, born of his own sowing;
                        or
                        be given as captured prey to the <span class="charmortal" about="Serpent">dragon</span>&apos;s
                        greed. If I allow this, then I am born of the
                        tigress: then I show I have a heart of stone and iron! Why can I not watch him die, and
                        shame my
                        eyes by seeing? Why do I not urge the bulls on, to meet him, and <span class="charimmortal"
                            about="LordsofDeath">the wild earth-born
                            warriors</span>,
                        and the <span class="charimmortal" about="Serpent">unsleeping dragon</span>? Let the gods also
                        desire the better! Though it is not for me to
                        pray
                        for, but to bring about.</p>
                    <p>Shall I betray my father&apos;s country? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers, and unhurt
                        because of me, without me, set his sails to the wind, and be husband to another, leaving
                        <span class="charmortal" about="Medea">Medea</span>
                        to be punished? If he could do that, if he could set another woman above me, let him die,
                        the
                        ungrateful man! But his look, his nobility of spirit, and his graceful form, do not make me
                        fear
                        deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness. And he will give me his word beforehand, and I will
                        gather the gods to witness our pledge. Why fear when it is certain? Prepare yourself, and
                        dispel
                        all delay: <span class="charmortal" about="Jason">Jason</span> will be for ever in your debt,
                        take you to himself in sacred marriage, and

                    </p>
                    <p>Carried by the winds, shall I leave my native country, my sister, my brother, my father, and
                        my
                        gods? Well then, my father is barbarous, and my country is savage, and my brother is still a
                        child: my sister&apos;s prayers are for me, and the greatest god is within! I will not be
                        leaving greatness behind, but pursuing greatness: honour as a saviour of these Achaean
                        people,
                        familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here, the

                        that the wide world owns, joined to whom I will be called fortunate, dear to the gods, and

                        afraid for him.</p>
                    <p>But do you call that marriage, <span class="charmortal" about="Medea">Medea</span>, and clothe

                        She went to the ancient altars of <span class="charimmortal" about="Hecate">Hecate</span>,
                        daughter of the Titan <span class="charimmortal" about="Perses">Perses</span>, that the shadowy
                        grove
                        conceals, in the remote forest. And now she was strong and her passion, now conquered, had
                        ebbed, when she saw the son of <span class="charmortal" about="Aeson">Aeson</span> and the
                        flame, that was dead, relit. Her cheeks
                        flushed,
                        and then her whole face became pallid. Just as a tiny spark that lies buried under the
                        ashes,
                        takes life from a breath of air, and grows and, living, regains its previous strength, so

                        for loving him. She gazed at him, and fixed her eyes on him as if she had never looked at

                        before, and in her infatuation, seeing his face, could not believe him mortal, nor could she
                        turn away. So that when, indeed, the stranger grasped her right hand, and began to speak,
                        and in
                        a submissive voice asked for her help, promising marriage, she replied in a flood of

                        by so many enemies, she grewpale, and sat there, suddenly cold and bloodless. And in case

                        as

                        to the victor, and hugged him in eager

                        modesty prevented it. Still, you might have held him, but concern for yourreputation
                        stopped you from doing so. What you might fittingly do you did, rejoicing silently,

                        and
                        sands that the ebbing tide ofocean washes. She adds hoar-frost collected by night under the
                        moon, the wings and flesh of a vilescreech-owl, and the slavering foam of a sacrificed
                        were-wolf, that can change its savage features to thoseof a man. She does not forget the
                        scaly
                        skin of a thin <span class="charimmortal">Cinyphian water-snake</span>, the liver of a <span
                            class="charimmortal">long-lived stag</span>, the eggs and the head
                        of a
                        <span class="charimmortal">crow that has lived for nine human life-times</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>With these, and a thousand other nameless things, <span class="charmortal">the barbarian
                            witch</span> pursued her greater
                        than
                        mortalpurpose. She stirred it all with a long-dry branch of a fruitful olive, mixing the
                        depths
                        with the surface. Look! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron, first grew green again,
                        then in a short time sproutedleaves, and was, suddenly, heavily loaded with olives. And
                        whenever
                        the flames caused froth to spatter fromthe hollow bronze, and warm drops to fall on the
                        earth,
                        the soil blossomed, and flowers and soft grasses grew.</p>
                    <p>As soon as she saw this, <span class="charmortal">Medea</span> unsheathed a knife, and cut the
                        old man&apos;s throat, and
                        letting
                        the old bloodout, filled the dry veins with the juice. When <span class="charmortal">Aeson</span> had
                        absorbed it, part
                        through
                        his mouth, and partthrough the wound, the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished, and
                        a
                        dark colour took its place. At a stroke his leanness went, and his pallor and dullness of
                        mind.
                        The deep hollows were filled with roundedflesh, and his limbs expanded. <span
                            class="charmortal">Aeson</span> marvelled,
                        recalling that this was his self of forty years ago.</p>

                        and
                        when she told them of one of her greatest gifts, the removal of Aeson&apos;s many years,
                        andlingered over it, hope was aroused in <span class="charmortal">Pelias&apos;s daughters</span>
                        that similar magic arts

                    <p>They begged her, and told her to set a price however great. She was silent for a moment,
                        and
                        appeared to hesitate, keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of
                        solemn
                        pretence. When, eventually,she promised to do it, she said<q>To give you greater

                        was
                        dragged forward, his horns curving round his hollow temples. When thewitch had cut his

                        throat with her Thessalian knife, hardly staining the blade with blood, sheimmersed the

                        its limbs, melted away its horns, and, with its horns, the years. A high-pitched bleating
                        came
                        from inside thevessel, and while they were wondering at the bleating, a lamb leapt out,
                        and
                        frisked away, seeking the udderand milk.</p>
                    <p><span class="charmortal">Pelias&apos;s daughters</span> were stunned, and now the truth of her
                        promise had been
                        displayed,
                        they
                        insisted even moreeagerly. Three times <span class="charimmortal">Phoebus</span> had unyoked his

                        into
                        the western ocean, and on the fourth night the stars were glittering in all their
                        radiance,
                        when
                        the deceitful <span class="charmortal">daughter of Aeetes</span> set clear water, and herbs, but
                        ineffectual ones, over a
                        blazing
                        fire. And now the king</span> and his guards also weredeep in death-like sleep, achieved by her

                        crossed the threshold, with <span class="charmortal">the Colchian witch</span>, and stood around

                    <p>Urged on by these words, the more love each had for him, the quicker she was to act

                        love,
                        and did evil, to avoid greater evil. Nevertheless they could not bear to see their own
                        blows,
                        and
                        turned their eyesaway, and with averted faces, wounded him blindly with cruel hands.

                        from
                        his bed. Stretching his pallid handsout among the many weapons, he cried<q>Daughters,

                    <p>At last, the dragon&apos;s wings brought her to <span class="places">Corinth</span>, the ancient
                        <span class="places">Ephyre</span>, and its Pirenian
                        spring. Here,tradition says, that in earliest times, human bodies sprang from fungi, swollen
                        by
                        rain. After <span class="charmortal">Jason</span>&apos;s newbride <span class="charmortal">Glauce</span> had
                        been consumed by the fires of vengeful Colchian
                        witchcraft and both the <span class="places">Isthmus</span>&apos;s gulfs hadwitnessed flame
                        consuming the king&apos;s
                        palace, <span class="charmortal">Medea</span> impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their
                        sons. Then, after performing
                        this
                        evil act, she fled from <span class="charmortal">Jason</span>&apos;s wrath. Carried by her
                        dragons that are born ofthe
                        <span class="charimmortal">Titans</span>,
                        she reached <span class="charimmortal">Pallas</span>&apos;s citadel of <span class="places">Athens</span>.
                        This once knew you <span class="charmortal">Phene</span>, the
                        most righteous,
                        and
                        you old <span class="charmortal">Periphas</span>, both flying in the air, as birds, the eagle
                        and the osprey: and <span class="charmortal">Alcyone</span>,
                        granddaughter of <span class="charmortal">Polypemon</span>, resting on strange new wings. It was
                        <span class="charmortal">Aegeus</span> who gave <span class="charmortal">Medea</span>
                        sanctuary
                        there, damned thereafter bythat one action: and not content with taking her in, he even
                        entered
                        into a contract of marriage with her.

                        <span class="charmortal">Aegeus</span>&apos;s son, but as yet unknown to him. He, by his courage,
                        had
                        brought peace to the <span class="places">Isthmus</span> between the two gulfs. <span

                        is
                        said to have dripped from the teeth of <span class="charimmortla">Cerberus</span>, the Echidnean
                        dog. There is a dark cavern
                        with a
                        gaping mouth, and a path into the depths, up which <span class="charimmortal">Hercules</span>,
                        hero of <span class="places">Tiryns</span>, dragged the dog,
                        tied with steel chains, resisting and twisting its eyesaway from the daylight and the
                        shining
                        rays. <span class="charimmortal">Cerberus</span>, provoked to a rabid frenzy, filled all the air
                        with his simultaneous
                        three-headed
                        howling, and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam. These aresupposed to have
                        congealed and found food to multiply, gaining harmful strength from the rich soil.
                        Because they
                        are long-lived, springing from the hard rock, the country people call these shoots, of
                        wolf-bane,
                        <q>soil-less&apos; aconites. Through his wife&apos;s cunning <span class="charmortal">Aegeus</span>, the
                            father, himself
                            offered
                            the poison to his son,as if he were a stranger. <span class="charmortal">Theseus</span>,
                            unwittingly, had taken the cup
                            he
                            was given in his right hand, when hisfather recognised the emblems of his own house, on

                            ivory hilt of his son&apos;s sword, and knocked the evildrink away from his mouth. But
