        <h2>Medea</h2>
        <p>Medea is certainly one of the most interesting characters of Ancient Greek Literature. Her magical powers and
            the terrible act of
            filicide have made her an interesting subject for many writers and artists, creating on one side a wild
            woman, justified by her own beliefs and culture in the terrible acts that she is pushed to, and on the
            other a scorned lover who did everything in her power to help a man that never rewarded her.</p>
        <p>Her story is linked many times with the Argonauts' one, and so does Ovid in his <q>Metamorphoses</q>:
            everything begins with a blooming and forbidden romance between Medea and Jason, the hero who came to her
            kingdom to steal its most valued possession, the notorious golden veil. Instead, Apollonius Rhodium
            describes Medea's slow descent in her
            love for Jason, showcasing the woman's feelings with an amazing precision and attention in an incredible
            display of psychological knowledge and expression.</p>
        <p>Through her knowledge of magic Medea helps her lover first in the conquest of the golden veil, offering
            him advice to win every trial imposed by her father, and then in the escape from
            Colchis and her father's clutches, when the sorceress reveals her bloodthirsty and determinate nature by
            killing her brother. Still, her love for Jason doesn't have an <i>happy ending</i>. After
            having found shelter in Corinth, Medea, Jason, and their children are hosted by the land's rightful king,
            Creon, who aims to marry off his own daughter to the infamous hero. Jason happily accepts the offer,
            fascinated by the allure of power and the possibility to have a younger and noble wife.
        </p>
        <p>Medea isn’t blind to her lovers's intentions and threads carefully her revenge, killing the children she
            generated with Jason after having gifted a poisoned dress and a golden crown to young Glauce, Jason’s
            soon-to-be-wife and princess of
            Corinth, effectively murdering her as well as her father,
            who just wanted to help his daughter. After having alienated herself from everyone whom she loved and having
            killed those who were closest to her, Medea runs away on the Sun’s chariot, travels to Athens and
            later back to Colchis to reunite with her father.</p>
        <p>All of this is also described in Euripides' tragedy by the same name as the infamous sorceress. The three
            authors we suggest for our repertory showcase three different
            perspectives on this mysterious woman, which we hope will further encourage your interest in such an
            interesting and magical figure.</p>

                <p>And now the Argonauts were ploughing through the sea in their ship, built in Thessalian
                    Pagasae.
                    They had visited Phineus, king of Thracian Salmydessus, living out a useless old age in
                    perpetual blindness, and the winged sons of Boreas had driven the birdlike Harpies from the
                    presence of the unhappy, aged man. At last, after enduring many trials, under their famous
                    leader, Jason, they reached the turbulent river-waters of the muddy Phasis, in the land of
                    Colchis. While they were standing before King Aeetes, of Aea, requesting the return of the
                    Golden Fleece, taken from the divine ram that carried Phrixus, and while extreme terms were
                    being imposed, involving daunting tasks, Medea, the daughter of the king, conceived an
                    overwhelming passion for Jason. She fought against it for a time, but when reason could not
                    overcome desire, she debated with herself.</p>
                <p><q>Medea, you struggle in vain: some god, I do not know which, opposes you. I wonder if this,
                        or
                        something, like this, is what people indeed call love? Or why would the tasks my father
                        demands of Jason seem so hard? They are more than hard! Why am I afraid of his death,
                        when I
                        have scarcely seen him? What is the cause of all this fear? Quench, if you can, unhappy
                        girl, these flames that you feel in your virgin heart! If I could, I would be wiser! But
                        a
                        strange power draws me to him against my will. Love urges one thing: reason another. I
                        see,
                        and I desire the better: I follow the worse. Why do you burn for a stranger, royal
                        virgin,
                        and dream of marriage in an alien land? This earth can also give you what you can love.
                        Whether he lives or dies, is in the hands of the gods. Let him live! I can pray for this
                        even if I may not love him: what is Jason guilty of? Who, but the heartless, would not
                        be
                        touched by Jason&apos;s youth, and birth, and courage? Who, though the other qualities
                        were
                        absent, could not be stirred by his beauty?</p>
                <p>He has stirred my heart, indeed. And unless I offer my help, he will feel the fiery breath of
                    the
                    bronze-footed bulls; have to meet that enemy, sprung from the soil, born of his own sowing;
                    or
                    be given as captured prey to the dragon&apos;s greed. If I allow this, then I am born of the
                    tigress: then I show I have a heart of stone and iron! Why can I not watch him die, and
                    shame my
                    eyes by seeing? Why do I not urge the bulls on, to meet him, and the wild earth-born
                    warriors,
                    and the unsleeping dragon? Let the gods also desire the better! Though it is not for me to
                    pray
                    for, but to bring about.</p>
                <p>Shall I betray my father&apos;s country? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers, and unhurt
                    because of me, without me, set his sails to the wind, and be husband to another, leaving
                    Medea
                    to be punished? If he could do that, if he could set another woman above me, let him die,
                    the
                    ungrateful man! But his look, his nobility of spirit, and his graceful form, do not make me
                    fear
                    deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness. And he will give me his word beforehand, and I will
                    gather the gods to witness our pledge. Why fear when it is certain? Prepare yourself, and
                    dispel
                    all delay: Jason will be for ever in your debt, take you to himself in sacred marriage, and
                    through the cities of Pelasgian Greece, the crowds of women will glorify you as his saviour.
                </p>
                <p>Carried by the winds, shall I leave my native country, my sister, my brother, my father, and
                    my
                    gods? Well then, my father is barbarous, and my country is savage, and my brother is still a
                    child: my sister&apos;s prayers are for me, and the greatest god is within! I will not be
                    leaving greatness behind, but pursuing greatness: honour as a saviour of these Achaean
                    people,
                    familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here, the
                    culture
                    and arts of those places, and the man, the son of Aeson, for whom I would barter those
                    things
                    that the wide world owns, joined to whom I will be called fortunate, dear to the gods, and
                    my
                    head will be crowned with the stars.</p>
                <p>What of the stories of mountains that clash together in mid-ocean, and Charybdis the bane of
                    sailors, now sucking in, now spewing out the sea, and rapacious dog-headed Scylla, yelping
                    over
                    the Sicilian deeps? Well, holding what I love, clinging to Jason&apos;s breast, I shall be
                    carried over the wide seas: in his arms, I will fear nothing, or if I am afraid, I will only
                    be
                    afraid for him.</p>
                <p>But do you call that marriage, Medea, and clothe your fault with fair names? Consider
                    instead,
                    how great a sin you are near to, and while you can, shun the crime!</q>She spoke, and in
                    front
                    of her eyes, were rectitude, piety, modesty: and now, Cupid, defeated, was turning away.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="MetVII74_99">
                <p>She went to the ancient altars of Hecate, daughter of the Titan Perses, that the shadowy
                    grove
                    conceals, in the remote forest. And now she was strong and her passion, now conquered, had
                    ebbed, when she saw the son of Aeson and the flame, that was dead, relit. Her cheeks
                    flushed,
                    and then her whole face became pallid. Just as a tiny spark that lies buried under the
                    ashes,
                    takes life from a breath of air, and grows and, living, regains its previous strength, so
                    now
                    her calmed passion, that you would have thought had dulled, when she saw the young hero,
                    flared
                    up at his visible presence.</p>
                <p>It chanced that Aeson&apos;s son was more than usually handsome that day: you could forgive
                    her
                    for loving him. She gazed at him, and fixed her eyes on him as if she had never looked at
                    him
                    before, and in her infatuation, seeing his face, could not believe him mortal, nor could she
                    turn away. So that when, indeed, the stranger grasped her right hand, and began to speak,
                    and in
                    a submissive voice asked for her help, promising marriage, she replied in a flood of
                    tears.<q>I
                        see what I am doing: it is not ignorance of the truth that ensnares me, but love. Your
                        salvation is in my gift, but being saved, remember your promise!</q></p>
                </p>He swore by the sacred rites of the Triple Goddess, by the divine presence of the grove, by
                the
                all-seeing Sun, who was the father of King Aeetes, his father-in-law to be, and by his own good
                fortune, and by his great danger. Immediately, as he was now trusted, he accepted the magic
                herbs
                from her, and learnt their use, and returned to the palace, joyfully.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="MetVII100_158">
                <p>The next day&apos;s dawn dispelled the glittering stars. Then the people gathered on the
                    sacred
                    field of Mars andtook up their position on the ridge. The king was seated in the middle,
                    clothed
                    in purple, and distinguishedby his ivory sceptre. Behold, the bronze-footed bulls, breathing
                    Vulcan&apos;s fire from nostrils of steel. Atthe touch of their heat the grass shrivels, and
                    as
                    stoked fires roar, or as broken limestone, that hasabsorbed the heat inside an earthen
                    furnace,
                    hisses explosively, when cool water is scattered over it, sothe flames sounded, pent up in
                    their
                    heaving chests and burning throats. Still the son of Aeson went out tomeet them.</p>
                <p>As he came to them, the fierce creatures, with their iron-tipped horns, turned their terrible
                    gaze towardshim, pawed the dusty ground with their cloven feet, and filled the air with the
                    steam of their bellowing.The Minyans were frozen in fear. He went up to the bulls, not
                    feeling
                    their fiery breath (so great is thepower of magic drugs!), and stroking their hanging
                    dewlaps,
                    with a bold hand, yoked them together, andforced them to pull the heavy blade, and till the
                    virgin field with the iron plough. The Colchians werestunned, but the Argonauts increased
                    their
                    shouting, and heightened his courage.</p>
                <p>Then he took the dragon&apos;s teeth from the bronze helmet, and scattered them over the
                    turned
                    earth. The soilsoftened the seeds that had been steeped in virulent poison, and they
                    sprouted,
                    and the teeth, freshly sown,produced new bodies. As an embryo takes on human form in the
                    mother&apos;s womb, and is fully developed there inevery aspect, not emerging to the living
                    air
                    until it is complete, so when those shapes of men had been madein the bowels of the pregnant
                    earth, they surged from the teeming soil, and, what is even more wonderful,clashed weapons,
                    created with them. The Pelasgians&apos; faces fell in fear, and their courage failed them,
                    whenthey saw these warriors preparing to hurl their sharp spears, at the head of the
                    Haemonian
                    hero. She also,who had rendered him safe, was afraid. When she saw the solitary youth
                    attacked
                    by so many enemies, she grewpale, and sat there, suddenly cold and bloodless. And in case
                    the
                    herbs she had given him had not beenpotent enough, she chanted a spell to support them, and
                    called on her secret arts.
                    <p>
                        <p>He threw a boulder into the midst of his enemies, and this turned their attack, on
                            him,
                            against themselves.The earth-born brothers died at each other&apos;s hands, and fell
                            as
                            in civil war. The Achaeans cheered, andclung to the victor, and hugged him in eager
                            embraces. You also, princess among the Barbarians, longed tohold the victorious man:
                            but
                            modesty prevented it. Still, you might have held him, but concern for yourreputation
                            stopped you from doing so. What you might fittingly do you did, rejoicing silently,
                            givingthanks, for your incantations, and the gods who inspired them.
                            <p>
                                <p>The final task was to put the dragon to sleep with the magic drugs. Known for
                                    its
                                    crest, its triple tonguesand curved fangs, it was the dread guardian of the
                                    tree&apos;s gold. But when Jason had sprinkled it with theLethean juice of a
                                    certain herb, and three times repeated the words that bring tranquil sleep,
                                    that
                                    calm therough seas and turbulent rivers, sleep came to those sleepless eyes,
                                    and
                                    the heroic son of Aeson gained theGolden Fleece. Proud of his prize, and
                                    taking
                                    with him a further prize, the one who had helped him gain it,the hero, and
                                    his
                                    wife Medea, returned to the harbour at Iolchos.</p>

                <p>The elderly Haemonian mothers and fathers bring offerings to mark their sons&apos; return,

                    dedicated, is
                    led in and killed. But Aesonis absent from the rejoicing, now near death, and weary with the
                    long years. Then Jason, his son, said<q>O mywife, to whom I confess I owe my life, though

                        years and add them to my father&apos;s!</q>He could not restrain his tears. Medea was
                    moved
                    bythe loving request, and the contrast with Aeetes, abandoned by her, came to mind. Yet, not
                    allowing herselfto be affected by such thoughts, she answered<q>Husband, what dreadful words
                        have escaped your lips? Do youthink I can transfer any part of your life to another?
                        Hecate
                        would not allow it: nor is yours a justrequest. But I will try to grant a greater gift
                        than
                        the one you ask for, Jason. If only the Triple Goddesswill aid me, and give her assent
                        in
                        person to this great act of daring, I will attempt to renew yourfather&apos;s length of

                    she
                    chose, as well, from the Amphrysus. Nor did she omit the Enipeus. Peneus,and
                    Spercheus&apos;s
                    waters gave something, and the reedy shores of Boebe. And at Anthedon, by Euboea, she
                    pickeda
                    plant of long life, not yet famous for the change it made in Glaucus&apos;s body.</p>
                <div id="MetVII234_293"></div>
                <p>Then she returned, after nine days and nine nights surveying all the lands she had crossed,
                    from
                    her chariot,drawn by the winged dragons. The dragons had only smelt the herbs, yet they shed
                    their skins of many years.Reaching her door and threshold, she stopped on the outside, and
                    under
                    the open sky, avoiding contact withany man, she set up two altars of turf, one on the right
                    to
                    Hecate, one on the left to Youth. She wreathedthem with sacred boughs from the wildwood,
                    then
                    dug two trenches near by in the earth, and performed thesacrifice, plunging her knife into
                    the
                    throat of a black-fleeced sheep, and drenching the wide ditches withblood. She poured over
                    it
                    cups of pure honey, and again she poured over it cups of warm milk, uttering wordsas she did
                    so,
                    calling on the spirits of the earth, and begging the shadowy king and his stolen bride,
                    notto be
                    too quick to steal life from the old man&apos;s limbs.</p>
                <p>When she had appeased the gods by prayer and murmured a while, she ordered Aeson&apos;s
                    exhausted
                    body to becarried into the air, and freeing him to deep sleep with her spells, she stretched
                    him
                    out like a corpse ona bed of herbs. She ordered Jason, his son, to go far off, and the
                    attendants to go far off, and warned themto keep profane eyes away from the mysteries. They
                    went
                    as she had ordered. Medea, with streaming hair,circled the burning altars, like a Bacchante,
                    and
                    dipping many-branched torches into the black ditchesfilled with blood, she lit them, once
                    they
                    were darkened, at the twin altars. Three times with fire, threetimes with water, three times
                    with sulphur, she purified the old man.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile a potent mixture is heating in a bronze cauldron set on the flames, bubbling, and
                    seething, whitewith turbulent froth. She boils there, roots dug from a Thessalian valley,
                    seeds,
                    flowerheads, and darkjuices. She throws in precious stones searched for in the distant east,
                    and
                    sands that the ebbing tide ofocean washes. She adds hoar-frost collected by night under the
                    moon, the wings and flesh of a vilescreech-owl, and the slavering foam of a sacrificed
                    were-wolf, that can change its savage features to thoseof a man. She does not forget the
                    scaly
                    skin of a thin Cinyphian water-snake, the liver of a long-livedstag, the eggs and the head
                    of a
                    crow that has lived for nine human life-times.</p>
                <p>With these, and a thousand other nameless things, the barbarian witch pursued her greater
                    than
                    mortalpurpose. She stirred it all with a long-dry branch of a fruitful olive, mixing the
                    depths
                    with the surface.Look! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron, first grew green again,
                    then in a short time sproutedleaves, and was, suddenly, heavily loaded with olives. And
                    whenever
                    the flames caused froth to spatter fromthe hollow bronze, and warm drops to fall on the
                    earth,
                    the soil blossomed, and flowers and soft grassesgrew.</p>
                <p>As soon as she saw this, Medea unsheathed a knife, and cut the old man&apos;s throat, and
                    letting
                    the old bloodout, filled the dry veins with the juice. When Aeson had absorbed it, part
                    through
                    his mouth, and partthrough the wound, the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished, and
                    a
                    dark colour took its place. At astroke his leanness went, and his pallor and dullness of
                    mind.
                    The deep hollows were filled with roundedflesh, and his limbs expanded. Aeson marvelled,
                    recalling that this was his self of forty years ago.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="MetVII294_349">
                <p>Bacchus saw this wondrous miracle from heaven&apos;s heights, and realising from it, that the
                    Nymphs of MountNysa, who had nursed him, could have their youth restored, he secured that
                    gift
                    from the witch of Colchis.There was no end to her magic. Phasian Medea, pretending to a sham
                    quarrel with her husband, fled as asuppliant to Pelias&apos;s threshold, he who had usurped
                    Aeson&apos;s throne. There, the king&apos;s daughters receivedher, since he himself was
                    weighed
                    down by the years. The lying Colchian soon won them over by a skilful showof friendship, and
                    when she told them of one of her greatest gifts, the removal of Aeson&apos;s many years,
                    andlingered over it, hope was aroused in Pelias&apos;s daughters that similar magic arts
                    might
                    rejuvenate theirfather.</p>
                <p>They begged her, and told her to set a price however great. She was silent for a moment, and
                    appeared tohesitate, keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of solemn
                    pretence. When, eventually,she promised to do it, she said<q>To give you greater confidence
                        in
                        my gift, your oldest ram, the leader ofyour flocks, will by turned into a young lamb
                        again,
                        by my magic drugs.</q>Straight away the woolly creature,worn out by innumerable years,
                    was
                    dragged forward, his horns curving round his hollow temples. When thewitch had cut his
                    wizened
                    throat with her Thessalian knife, hardly staining the blade with blood, sheimmersed the
                    sheep&apos;s carcass in the bronze cauldron, along with her powerful magic herbs. These
                    shrank
                    itslimbs, melted away its horns, and, with its horns, the years. A high-pitched bleating
                    came
                    from inside thevessel, and while they were wondering at the bleating, a lamb leapt out, and
                    frisked away, seeking the udderand milk.</p>
                <p>Pelias&apos;s daughters were stunned, and now the truth of her promise had been displayed,
                    they
                    insisted even moreeagerly. Three times Phoebus had unyoked his horses, after their plunge
                    into
                    the western ocean, and on thefourth night the stars were glittering in all their radiance,
                    when
                    the deceitful daughter of Aeetes setclear water, and herbs, but ineffectual ones, over a
                    blazing
                    fire. And now the king and his guards also weredeep in death-like sleep, achieved by her
                    incantations and the power of her magic spells. The king&apos;sdaughters, at her command,
                    crossed the threshold, with the Colchian witch, and stood around his bed.<q>Why doyou
                        hesitate,
                        so timidly?</q>she said.<q>Un-sheath your blades, and let out the old blood, so that I
                        can
                        fillthe empty veins with new! You father&apos;s life and youth are in your hands. If you
                        have any filial affection,if those are not vain hopes that stir you, render your father
                        this
                        service, banish old age with yourweapons, and drive out his poisoned blood with a stroke
                        of
                        the iron blade!</q></p>
                <p>Urged on by these words, the more love each had for him, the quicker she was to act without
                    love,
                    and didevil, to avoid greater evil. Nevertheless they could not bear to see their own blows,
                    and
                    turned their eyesaway, and with averted faces, wounded him blindly with cruel hands.
                    Streaming
                    blood, the old man stillraised himself on his elbow, and, though mutilated, tried to rise
                    from
                    his bed. Stretching his pallid handsout among the many weapons, he cried<q>Daughters, why
                        are
                        you doing this? What has made you take up weaponsagainst your father&apos;s
                        life?</q>Their
                    strength and courage vanished. But as he was about to utter more words,the Colchian witch
                    cut
                    his throat, and plunged his torn body into the seething water.</p>

                <p>She would not have escaped punishment had she not taken to the air, with her winged dragons.
                    Through thehigh sky, clockwise, she fled, over the shadowy slopes of Pelion, Chiron&apos;s
                    home;
                    over Othrys and the placesmade famous by the ancient fate of Cerambus, who, aided by the
                    nymphs
                    and changed to a winged scarab beetle,lifted into the air, when the all-powerful sea drowned
                    the
                    solid earth, and so escaped un-drowned fromDeucalion&apos;s flood. She passed Aeolian Pitane
                    on
                    the left, with its huge stone serpent image, and Ida&apos;s grovewhere Liber concealed, in
                    the
                    deceptive shape of a stag, the bullock stolen by his son. She passed the placewhere the
                    father
                    of Corythus, Paris, lay, buried under a little sand; and where Hecuba, changed to a
                    blackbitch
                    of Hecate, Maera, spread terror through the fields with her strange barking.</p>
                <p>She flew over Astypalaea, the city of Eurypylus, where the women of the island, of Cos,
                    acquired
                    horns whenthey abused Hercules, as he and his company departed: over Rhodes, beloved of
                    Phoebus:
                    and the Telchines ofthe city of Ialysos on Rhodes, whose eyes corrupted everything they
                    looked
                    on, so that Jupiter, disgustedwith them, sank them under his brother&apos;s ocean waves. She
                    passed the walls of ancient Carthaea, on theisland of Ceos, where Alcidamas, as a father,
                    would
                    marvel, one day, that a peace-loving dove could springfrom the body of his daughter,
                    Ctesylla.
                </p>
                <p>Then she saw Lake Hyrie, and Cycnean Tempe, made famous suddenly by a swan. There Phylius, at
                    the
                    boyCycnus&apos;s command, brought him birds and a fierce lion he had tamed. Ordered to
                    overcome
                    a wild bull as well,he did overcome him, but angry that his love was rejected so often, he
                    refused to grant this last gift of abull, when asked. Cycnus, angered, said<q>You will wish
                        you
                        had</q>and leapt from a high cliff. All thought hehad fallen, but changed to a swan he
                    beat
                    through the air on white wings, though his mother, Hyrie, notknowing he was safe, pined away
                    with weeping, and became the lake that carries her name.</p>
                <p>Near there was the city of Pleuron, where Combe the daughter of Ophius, on flickering wings,
                    escaped death atthe hands of her sons, the Aetolian Curetes. And then Medea looked down at
                    the
                    fields of Calaurea&apos;s isle,sacred to Leto, whose king and queen were also changed to
                    birds.
                    On her right was Cyllene, where Menephronlay with his mother, as though he were a wild
                    beast.
                    Further on she sees the Cephisus, the river-godlamenting his grandson&apos;s fate, changed
                    by
                    Apollo into a lumbering seal, and the home of Eumelus, mourninghis son Botres, reborn as a
                    bird,
                    the bee-eater, in the air.</p>
                <p>At last, the dragon&apos;s wings brought her to Corinth, the ancient Ephyre, and its Pirenian
                    spring. Here,tradition says, that in earliest times, human bodies sprang from fungi, swollen
                    by
                    rain. After Jason&apos;s newbride Glauce had been consumed by the fires of vengeful Colchian
                    witchcraft and both the Isthmus&apos;s gulfs hadwitnessed flame consuming the king&apos;s
                    palace, Medea impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their sons.Then, after performing
                    this
                    evil act, she fled from Jason&apos;s wrath. Carried by her dragons that are born ofthe
                    Titans,
                    she reached Pallas&apos;s citadel of Athens. This once knew you Phene, the most righteous,
                    and
                    youold Periphas, both flying in the air, as birds, the eagle and the osprey: and Alcyone,
                    granddaughter ofPolypemon, resting on strange new wings. It was Aegeus who gave Medea
                    sanctuary
                    there, damned thereafter bythat one action: and not content with taking her in, he even
                    entered
                    into a contract of marriage with her.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="MetVII404_424">
                <p>Now Theseus came to Athens, Aegeus&apos;s son, but as yet unknown to him. He, by his courage,
                    had
                    brought peace tothe Isthmus between the two gulfs. Medea, seeking his destruction, prepared
                    a
                    mixture of poisonous aconite,she had brought with her from the coast of Scythia. This poison
                    is
                    said to have dripped from the teeth ofCerberus, the Echidnean dog. There is a dark cavern
                    with a
                    gaping mouth, and a path into the depths, upwhich Hercules, hero of Tiryns, dragged the dog,
                    tied with steel chains, resisting and twisting its eyesaway from the daylight and the
                    shining
                    rays. Cerberus, provoked to a rabid frenzy, filled all the air withhis simultaneous
                    three-headed
                    howling, and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam. These aresupposed to have
                    congealed and found food to multiply, gaining harmful strength from the rich soil.
                    Becausethey
                    are long-lived, springing from the hard rock, the country people call these shoots, of
                    wolf-bane,
                    <q>soil-less&apos; aconites. Through his wife&apos;s cunning Aegeus, the father, himself
                        offered
                        the poison to his son,as if he were a stranger. Theseus, unwittingly, had taken the cup
                        he
                        was given in his right hand, when hisfather recognised the emblems of his own house, on
                        the
                        ivory hilt of his son&apos;s sword, and knocked the evildrink away from his mouth. But
                        she
                        escaped death, in a dark mist, raised by her incantations.</p>
