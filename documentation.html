    <h2>Documentation of the Project</h2>
    <div id="projintro">
      <h3>Project introduction</h3>
      <p><i>Dead Lovers Society</i> is a metadata-enriched and stylistically
        customizable magazine on tragic love stories. The project has been developed in the framework of the course
        “Information Modelling and Web Technologies”, held by Prof Vitali for the MA in “Digital Humanities and
        Digital
        Knowledge” in the a. y. 2021/2022.</p>

      <p>The topic of this digital-born magazine stems out from one of the most important masterpiece of Latin
        literature, Ovid’s <i>Heroides</i>: this digital environment is intended as an occasion to bring online the
        tragic love stories of many heroines of the past, from the classical antiquity to modern days.</p>

      <p>Each story is told from at least three different points of view: the same narrative sequences may hence be
        rearranged or described from a different perspective. Conscious of the risk of relying exclusively on a
        translated text, we decided to add the possibility to read the document in the original language. The implied
        reader of this magazine are hence diversified, as its issue can be read with a different purpose: from the most
        naïve passion for reading to the interest in interlinguistic comparison.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="websitstruct">
      <h3>Website infrastructure</h3>
      <p>The web-application mainly consists of a set of HTML pages, edited through CSS
        stylesheets and animated thanks to JavaScript scripts. Some parts of its (e.g. navbar, footer, heroimage etc)
        are rendered through predefined model taken from Bootstrap or other sources. Their provenance is usually
        indicated in a comment within the source-code. These assets have been slightly modified according to our needs
        and to respect the stylistic features of the historical teaming. These imported assets are the sole situations
        where the dimensions can be measured in absolute value (i.e. in pixel). The original contents of the web
        application are instead measured in em, which grants the overall responsivity of the site</p>

      <p> Up to now, the application consists of three main HTML pages:
        <ul>
          <li>index.html: homepage of the website, containing the general information about the project and a carousel
            displaying all the issues of the magazine</li>
          <li>medea.html: containing the first issue, dedicated to the Greek witch Medea. Here character is briefly
            presented by an abstract and her story is told by Euripides, Apollonius Rhodius and Ovid. Each text, which
            has been separatedly marked up and here uploaded through an Ajax function, can be read in English and
            compared (also paragraph to paragraph) with the original Greek and Latin source. Moreover, an ad hoc tab
            allow to surf through the metadata of the publication (see under). The other two issues about Dido and
            Guinevevre are not available yet.</li>
          <li>documentation.html: currently displayed, contains the documentation of the project</li>
        </ul>
        Each page starts with a double navbar: the first one is the sitemap, while the second one allows to change the
        different styles at any moment.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="metadatadoc">
      <h3>Metadata enrichment</h3>
      <p>Following the paradigm proposed by the Text Encoding Initiative with the tags &lt;placeName&gt; and
        &lt;persName&gt;, we chose three main themes as basis of the metadata enrichment:
        <ul>
          <li>Mortal characters: in this section are included mostly mortals and a few demigods, which weren't later
            rendered immortal (e.g.: Jason).</li>
          <li>Immortal characters: in here we can find the gods and monsters cited by the works we chose, alongside a
            few personifications of natural elements, emotions and intangible entities(e.g.: War).</li>
          <li>Places: in here, instead, we have all the places cited by the works.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>We thought these three main thematics to be the most adapt for our text, since we are dealing with
      mythological texts of various genres (both of an upper and lower level) and the most useful for our reader.</p>
      <p>In fact whereas an expert reader might benefit from a detailed analysis, an inexpert one might be more
        interested into simply tracking the main characters of the works or the places, out of curiosity.</p>
      <p>After having chose our main entities, we thought of executing a simple entity recognition of mortal
        characters, immortal characters and places.</p>
      <p>In fact, the reader has two main services when it comes to the metadata:
        <ul>
          <li>On one side there is the possibility through checkboxes - activated by a Javascript function through the
            employment of Jquery selectors - to display all the metadata that correspond to a certain theme, this way
            the user can execute a larger analysis on the entirety of the text. </li>
          <li>Secondly, all the metadata found by the checkboxes are showcased on tabs and through clicking the
            specific name, you are brought to the part in the text where the metadata is stored, for a more specific
            analysis.<br>
            This is obtained through a few Javascript functions and the use of Jquery selectors, again on an already
            marked up text.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Moving from a metadata-based analysis, we also offer the possibility to compare the original Greek text with
        the English one, fully or just through some narrative sequences.</p>
      <p>It is also possible to shift quickly through the works chosen, employing a json file, which contains the html
        of texts. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="histolayout">
      <h3>Historical theming</h3>
      <p>The website was at first projected in the style currently displayed as
        "2020s". It is based on nowadays trending features in typography (such as, <i>Wired</i>) both in font and in
        page layout and adopts a
        very minimalistic aesthetic to what concerns colors and image filters. On the basis of these stylesheet, other
        six different themes, in order to philologically reconstruct specific typographical tastes. The general
        concepts
        of historical typography is taken from Guity Novin, "History of Layout Design and Modern Newspaper &
        Magazins",
        <i>A History of Graphic Design</i>.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h4>Aldo Manuzio&apos;s print edition (<i>Aldine</i>)</h4>
        <p>Aldus Manuntius was probably one of the most influential men during the end of the XV and the beginning of
          the XVI century.</p>
        <p>In 1494 he changed for ever the way people were able to perceive culture, through opening the "Aldine Press"
          and starting the creating of <q>libelli portatiles.</q></p>
        <p>In fact the books that he created were printed in the small <q>octavo</q> size, which isn't much different
          from our own paperback editions, effectively handling to people an instrument that could be read easily,
          everywhere and efficiently.</q>
          <p>Other than coming up with a new book format, Aldus Manuntius also was one of the first that started
            printing
            ancient Greek and Latin texts, for example, publishing Plato's works, with a Latin preface and dedicating
            such
            an edition to Pope Leo X.</p>
          <p>We thought that this detail might be very interesting and quite fitting for the texts we have chosen, which
            are part of Greek and Latin works, hence in our choice we continue Manuntius' goal to further educate
            people,
            in these new subjects.</p>
          <p>Aside from handling his own publishing house, Manuntius also collaborated with Francesco Griffo to further
            create and embellish his style and he both came up with new typefaces:
            <ul>
              <li> the humanist typeface </li>
              <li> the italic typeface </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both typefaces are well known to us and are still very much use (mostly the second one), but these aren't
              the
              only things that Manuntius' collaboration with Francesco Griffo created.</p>
            <p>Francesco Griffo (or better Francesco da Bologna, as he was known before 1883) actually created a new
              font,
              the Griffo, which we employed in the Aldine style, as an homage to this artisan who created a new style
              and
              was actually a strict collaborator of Aldus Manuntius till a fight brought them apart</p>
            <p>We also were very careful with the choice of the colors, basing ourself on the editions that have arrived
              to
              us, to make our reader feel like he is reading an actual Aldine edition but also giving them the best
              accessible possible and readability for the texts</p>
            <p>We do hope we were able to convey with our style the simplicity, correcteness and beauty that
              characterized
              many of the Aldine editions</p>

        <h4>XIX century&apos;s newspaper</h4>
        <p>Even though there were some differences and variations, American newspapers
          from the beginning of the XIX century shared some layout characteristics: the front page bore, at the top, a
          nameplate with the newspaper's title, its place of publication and other information regarding the date,
          volume
          and number of the issue. Inside, there was the masthead, containing repeated information of the nameplate
          (such
          as the newspaper's title, place and date of publication and so on).</p>
        <p>For what concerns the content, there is less consistency: some newspapers filled the front page with
          advertisement and left only the subsequent page(s) to the actual news, while others did the opposite or mixed
          advertisement and news. After the introduction of the printing press machine (1814), newspapers became larger,
          the most important
          ones expanding to six or eight pages, each with eight to ten columns of texts (and the columns ran the full
          length of the page). Advertisements were difficult to distinguish from news articles, as they had little
          graphic
          display (and newspapers consisted primarily of text even by the late 1850s).</p>
        <p>Moreover, as seen from some original artifacts, we can see how the margins of the written section were the
          only ones of some extent, while those between different columns are very restricted and almost imperceptible
          if
          not for the vertical lines dividing them. Again, by studying some original artefacts (found in the Library of
          Congress archives) we could see that for what concerns the title, in the beginning of the XIX century Gothic
          or
          blackletter style fonts were the most used apart from a few exceptions (The Sun or The Tri-weekly Standard
          being
          some of them).</p>

        <h4>Bauhaus</h4>
        <p>To epitomize a typographic style of the first half of the 20th century we
          decided to draw inspiration from the Bauhaus. Indeed, the design school paid attention not only to
          architecture
          and object design but devoted many effort also in the typographical domain. This impact resulted not only in
          the
          worldwide famous panel with writings laid in geometrical manner, but also in famous commercial products, as
          the
          cover of the "Penguin Classics", proposed by Jan Tschichold.</p>
        <p>In this project, the "Bauhaus" style is strictly based on real example of the Weimar school of design. As
          reference text, we used the original version of Gropius' manifesto <i>Idee und Aufbau des staatlichen
            Bauhaus</i>. Analyzing a digital facsmile available on Monoskop it was possible to infere the proportion of
          the different parts. The font is set to the default size (1em) and a drop cap is added as in the cover of the
          manifesto, while the margin has been calculated to be 5% of the entire width of the displayed page.</p>
        <p>
          To what concerns the choice of the colors and of paratextual elements, we decided to take inspiration directly
          from original artefacts of the period. Bauhaus' publication always included illustration and diagrams, quite
          always rendered in the bichromy of black and white: this feature suggested the introduction of a full
          grayscale
          filter on all the images present of the webapp. To avoid an excessive monotony of the page, we also combined
          this aspect with a color palette directly taken from import artists of Bauhaus' milieu: for this reason the
          entire style is dominated by primary colors directly taken from the original artifacts through color picker
          softwares. Moreover, the presence of ortogonal elements is respected thanks to the customization of the
          borders
          of the div elements (either on the four sides or only on two, in right angle).</p>

        <p>Referred and infamous in popculture, <i>Vogue</i> was created in 1892 in New York by Arthur Baldwin Turnure,
          although it was later acquired by the group, Condé Nast, which is still its owner.</p>
        <p>Through time this weekly newspaper spread through countries and centuries, bringing more and more interestng
          and specific articles, and most importantly memorable covers, which have become its trademark.</p>
        <p>We chose to focus on a specific timezone of <i>Vogue</i> articles, choosing the period that goes from the 90s
          to the early 00s.</p>
        <p>During this time the newspaper had published:
          <ul>
            <li>its first cover with a male on the cover (Richard Gere in 1992)</li>
            <li>a cover with all the ten most iconic and paid models of those years (April 1992) and another one with
            </li>
            <li>another one with Hilary Clinton becoming the first featured first lady in 1998</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The design of this style was actually highly inspired by the cover of August 1993, both in a matter of colors
          and layout.</p>
        <p>On one side the choice of the colors involved in this project wasn't accidental and we actually researched
          the
          most used colors of those years, both using the ones in past Vogue covers, but also searching the color
          palettes
          which were the most famous in those years.</p>
        <p>We also chose to give to the section about the authors and works, a layout that would mimick the one inside
          of
          the edition we chose, with the two columns dvision.</p>
        <p>It's also important to point out that we used as a font, <i>Didot</i>, which is a simplified version of the
          original one used in the Vogue cover with the permission of Linotype</p>
        <p>Through time, the long changed and evolved itself, but the magazine kept on using many of Firmin Didot's
          fonts,
          till in the 2004-2005 Terminal Design took over the deisgn of the logo.</p>
        <p>What is also a pivotal element of <i>Vogue</i> is images, and in this case we tried our best to actually
          accentuate their brightness and intensity, since it's be important they'd be in full focus, since many times
          it's what catches people's eyes.</p>
        <p>Because of this they are used in various ways through text, to communicate and help the text convey the
          message
          and catch the reader's attention.</p>
        <p>Obviously every style choice was attentive thought to be also as accessible and easily-readable by the
          reader,
          as possible.</p>

        <h4>Future</h4>
        <p>We define as "future" a style which is likely to be applied in the close
          future (approximately, 2030). For this reason, it was not possible to faithfully emulate an original document.
          We hence took inspiration from recent technological development such as "Google Infinite Scroll": in
          contradiction with the paradigm of little content in a broad space, we decided to mantain the layout structure
          used nowadays. To increase the breath of the text we set higher left and right margins.</p>
        <p>
          To what concerns typographic and color details we relied on the aesthetical canon of the vaporwave movement,
          which has been often used in science fiction content. The page is hence characterized by two different fonts:
          the first one is pixelled and used exclusively in the navbars of the header; the second one is more readable
          and
          is hence
          applied to the textual content. All the color are instead taken from pre-existent color palette directly
          availble online (in particular Pinterest). Moreover, these nuances have been chosen also for the image filter,
          which wants to resemble some of the most trending effects used nowadays (e.g., memes). As can be seen in the
          final output, the nouances are mainly taken from the spectrum of pink and violet (as suggested also by the
          background gradient). The massive presence of purple tones are to be justified with the traditional connection
          between this color and witchcraft, a magical art practiced by the first protagonist of our magazine, Medea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, looking also at the recent development in the artistic field (e.g. post-drammatic theatre), we though
          that future typography might rely on multimedia material, such as music. For this purpose, we added the
          possibility to listen to a soundtrack while reading the articles (click the button to play or pause). The
          chosen song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NqnPNV-llk">Glass Animals' <i>Heat Waves</i></a><sup
            onclick="alert('Its use here is not intended to be an alternative or replace its original location available at the embedded link. All copyrights and related rights on the content remain with their original owners.')">1</sup>.
          The choice of this track is due to two reasons: firstly, the band choses vaporwave aesthetic in the cover of
          the
          album. Secondly, at an interdiscoursive level, the track and the history of Medea show common motifs. The
          ossessive thoughts of Medea at the very beginning of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, VII, seems to anticipate
          Glass
          Animals' refrain.</p>
