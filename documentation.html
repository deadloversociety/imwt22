    <h2>Documentation of the Project</h2>
    <div id="projintro">
      <h3>Project introduction</h3>
      <p><i><span class="firstletter">D</span>ead Lovers Society</i> is a metadata-enriched and stylistically
        customizable magazine on tragic love stories. The project has been developed in the framework of the course
        “Information Modelling and Web Technologies”, held by Prof Vitali for the MA in “Digital Humanities and Digital
        Knowledge” in the a. y. 2021/2022.</p>

      <p>The topic of this digital-born magazine stems out from one of the most important masterpiece of Latin
        literature, Ovid’s <i>Heroides</i>: this digital environment is intended as an occasion to bring online the
        tragic love stories of many heroines of the past, from the classical antiquity to modern days.</p>

      <p>Each story is told from at least three different points of view: the same narrative sequences may hence be
        rearranged or described from a different perspective. Conscious of the risk of relying exclusively on a
        translated text, we decided to add the possibility to read the document in the original language. The implied
        reader of this magazine are hence diversified, as its issue can be read with a different purpose: from the most
        naïve passion for reading to the interest in interlinguistic comparison.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="websitstruct">
      <h3>Website infrastructure</h3>
      <p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he web-application mainly consists of a set of HTML pages, edited through CSS
        stylesheets and animated thanks to JavaScript scripts. Some parts of its (e.g. navbar, footer, heroimage etc)
        are rendered through predefined model taken from Bootstrap or other sources. Their provenance is usually
        indicated in a comment within the source-code. These assets have been slightly modified according to our needs
        and to respect the stylistic features of the historical teaming. These imported assets are the sole situations
        where the dimensions can be measured in absolute value (i.e. in pixel). The original contents of the web
        application are instead measured in em, which grants the overall responsivity of the site</p>
      <p> Up to now, the application consists of three main HTML pages:
        <ul>
          <li>index.html: homepage of the website, containing the general information about the project and a carousel
            displaying all the issues of the magazine</li>
          <li>medea.html: containing the first issue, dedicated to the Greek witch Medea. Here character is briefly
            presented by an abstract and her story is told by Euripides, Apollonius Rhodius and Ovid. Each text, which
            has been separatedly marked up and here uploaded through an Ajax function, can be read in English and
            compared (also paragraph to paragraph) with the original Greek and Latin source. Moreover, an ad hoc tab
            allow to surf through the metadata of the publication (see under). The other two issues about Dido and
            Guinevevre are not available yet.</li>
          <li>documentation.html: currently displayed, contains the documentation of the project</li>
        </ul>
        Each page starts with a double navbar: the first one is the sitemap, while the second one allows to change the
        different styles at any moment.</p>

        very minimalistic aesthetic to what concerns colors and image filters. On the basis of these stylesheet, other
        six different themes, in order to philologically reconstruct specific typographical tastes.</p>

      <h4>XIX century&apos;s newspaper</h4>
      <p><span class="firstletter">E</span>ven though there were some differences and variations, American newspapers
        from the beginning of the XIX century shared some layout characteristics: the front page bore, at the top, a
        nameplate with the newspaper's title, its place of publication and other information regarding the date, volume
        and number of the issue. Inside, there was the masthead, containing repeated information of the nameplate (such
        as the newspaper's title, place and date of publication and so on).
        <br>For what concerns the content, there is less consistency: some newspapers filled the front page with
        advertisement and left only the subsequent page(s) to the actual news, while others did the opposite or mixed
        advertisement and news.
        <br>After the introduction of the printing press machine (1814), newspapers became larger, the most important
        ones expanding to six or eight pages, each with eight to ten columns of texts (and the columns ran the full
        length of the page). Advertisements were difficult to distinguish from news articles, as they had little graphic
        display (and newspapers consisted primarily of text even by the late 1850s).
        <br>Moreover, as seen from some original artifacts, we can see how the margins of the written section were the
        only ones of some extent, while those between different columns are very restricted and almost imperceptible if
        not for the vertical lines dividing them. Again, by studying some original artefacts (found in the Library of
        Congress archives) we could see that for what concerns the title, in the beginning of the XIX century Gothic or
        blackletter style fonts were the most used apart from a few exceptions (The Sun or The Tri-weekly Standard being
        some of them).

      <h4>Bauhaus</h4>
      <p><span class="firstletter">T</span>o epitomize a typographic style of the first half of the 20th century we
        decided to draw inspiration from the Bauhaus. Indeed, the design school paid attention not only to architecture
        and object design but devoted many effort also in the typographical domain. This impact resulted not only in the
        worldwide famous panel with writings laid in geometrical manner, but also in famous commercial products, as the
        cover of the "Penguin Classics", proposed by Jan Tschichold.<br>
        In this project, the "Bauhaus" style is strictly based on real example of the Weimar school of design. As
        reference text, we used the original version of Gropius' manifesto <i>Idee und Aufbau des staatlichen
          Bauhaus</i>. Analyzing a digital facsmile available on Monoskop it was possible to infere the proportion of
        the different parts. The font is set to the default size (1em) and a drop cap is added as in the cover of the
        manifesto, while the margin has been calculated to be 5% of the entire width of the displayed page.<br>
        To what concerns the choice of the colors and of paratextual elements, we decided to take inspiration directly
        from original artefacts of the period. Bauhaus' publication always included illustration and diagrams, quite
        always rendered in the bichromy of black and white: this feature suggested the introduction of a full grayscale
        filter on all the images present of the webapp. To avoid an excessive monotony of the page, we also combined
        this aspect with a color palette directly taken from import artists of Bauhaus' milieu: for this reason the
        entire style is dominated by primary colors directly taken from the original artifacts through color picker
        softwares. Moreover, the presence of ortogonal elements is respected thanks to the customization of the borders
        of the div elements (either on the four sides or only on two, in right angle).

      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p><span class="firstletter">W</span>e define as "future" a style which is likely to be applied in the close
        future (approximately, 2030). For this reason, it was not possible to faithfully emulate an original document.
        We hence took inspiration from recent technological development such as "Google Infinite Scroll": in
        contradiction with the paradigm of little content in a broad space, we decided to mantain the layout structure
        used nowadays. To increase the breath of the text we set higher left and right margins.<br>
        To what concerns typographic and color details we relied on the aesthetical canon of the vaporwave movement,
        which has been often used in science fiction content. The page is hence characterized by two different fonts:
        the first one is pixelled and used exclusively in the navbars; the second one is more readable and is hence
        applied to the textual content. All the color are instead taken from pre-existent color palette directly
        availble online (in particular Pinterest). Moreover, these nuances have been chosen also for the image filter,
        which wants to resemble some of the most trending effects used nowadays (in particular, memes).<br><br>
