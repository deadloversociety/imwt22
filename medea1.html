        <h2>Medea</h2>
        <p>Medea is certainly one of the most interesting characters of Ancient Greek Literature. Her magical powers and
            the terrible act of
            filicide have made her an interesting subject for many writers and artists, creating on one side a wild
            woman, justified by her own beliefs and culture in the terrible acts that she is pushed to, and on the
            other a scorned lover who did everything in her power to help a man who never rewarded her.</p>
        <p>Her story is linked many times with the Argonauts' one, and so does Ovid in his <q>Metamorphoses</q>:
            everything begins with a blooming and forbidden romance between Medea and Jason, the hero who came to her
            kingdom to steal its most valued possession, the notorious golden veil. Instead, Apollonius Rhodium
            describes Medea's slow descent in her
            love for Jason, showcasing the woman's feelings with an amazing precision and attention in an incredible
            display of psychological knowledge and expression.</p>
        <p>Through her knowledge of magic Medea helps her lover first in the conquest of the golden veil, offering
            him advice to win every trial imposed by her father, and then in the escape from
            Colchis and her father's clutches, when the sorceress reveals her bloodthirsty and determinate nature by
            killing her brother. Still, her love for Jason doesn't have a <i>happy ending</i>. After
            having found shelter in Corinth, Medea, Jason, and their children are hosted by the land's rightful king,
            Creon, who aims to marry off his own daughter to the infamous hero. Jason happily accepts the offer,
            fascinated by the allure of power and the possibility of having a younger and noble wife.
        </p>
        <p>Medea isn’t blind to her lovers's intentions and threads carefully her revenge, killing the children she
            generated with Jason after having gifted a poisoned dress and a golden crown to young Glauce, Jason’s
            soon-to-be-wife and princess of
            Corinth, effectively murdering her as well as her father,
            who just wanted to help his daughter. After having alienated herself from everyone whom she loved and having
            killed those who were closest to her, Medea runs away on the Sun’s chariot, travels to Athens and
            later back to Colchis to reunite with her father.</p>
        <p>All of this is also described in Euripides' tragedy by the same name as the infamous sorceress. The three
            authors we suggest for our repertory showcase three different
            perspectives on this mysterious woman, which we hope will further encourage your interest in such an
            interesting and magical figure.</p>

                            <p>And now the Argonauts were ploughing through the sea in their ship, built in Thessalian
                                Pagasae.
                                They had visited Phineus, king of Thracian Salmydessus, living out a useless old age in
                                perpetual blindness, and the winged sons of Boreas had driven the birdlike Harpies from
                                the
                                presence of the unhappy, aged man. At last, after enduring many trials, under their
                                famous
                                leader, Jason, they reached the turbulent river-waters of the muddy Phasis, in the land
                                of
                                Colchis. While they were standing before King Aeetes, of Aea, requesting the return of
                                the
                                Golden Fleece, taken from the divine ram that carried Phrixus, and while extreme terms
                                were
                                being imposed, involving daunting tasks, Medea, the daughter of the king, conceived an
                                overwhelming passion for Jason. She fought against it for a time, but when reason could
                                not
                                overcome desire, she debated with herself.</p>
                            <p><q>Medea, you struggle in vain: some god, I do not know which, opposes you. I wonder if
                                    this,
                                    or
                                    something, like this, is what people indeed call love? Or why would the tasks my
                                    father
                                    demands of Jason seem so hard? They are more than hard! Why am I afraid of his
                                    death,
                                    when I
                                    have scarcely seen him? What is the cause of all this fear? Quench, if you can,
                                    unhappy
                                    girl, these flames that you feel in your virgin heart! If I could, I would be wiser!
                                    But
                                    a
                                    strange power draws me to him against my will. Love urges one thing: reason another.
                                    I
                                    see,
                                    and I desire the better: I follow the worse. Why do you burn for a stranger, royal
                                    virgin,
                                    and dream of marriage in an alien land? This earth can also give you what you can
                                    love.
                                    Whether he lives or dies, is in the hands of the gods. Let him live! I can pray for
                                    this
                                    even if I may not love him: what is Jason guilty of? Who, but the heartless, would
                                    not
                                    be
                                    touched by Jason&apos;s youth, and birth, and courage? Who, though the other
                                    qualities
                                    were
                                    absent, could not be stirred by his beauty?</p>
                            <p>He has stirred my heart, indeed. And unless I offer my help, he will feel the fiery
                                breath of
                                the
                                bronze-footed bulls; have to meet that enemy, sprung from the soil, born of his own
                                sowing;
                                or
                                be given as captured prey to the dragon&apos;s greed. If I allow this, then I am born of
                                the
                                tigress: then I show I have a heart of stone and iron! Why can I not watch him die, and
                                shame my
                                eyes by seeing? Why do I not urge the bulls on, to meet him, and the wild earth-born
                                warriors,
                                and the unsleeping dragon? Let the gods also desire the better! Though it is not for me
                                to
                                pray
                                for, but to bring about.</p>
                            <p>Shall I betray my father&apos;s country? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers, and
                                unhurt
                                because of me, without me, set his sails to the wind, and be husband to another, leaving
                                Medea
                                to be punished? If he could do that, if he could set another woman above me, let him
                                die,
                                the
                                ungrateful man! But his look, his nobility of spirit, and his graceful form, do not make
                                me
                                fear
                                deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness. And he will give me his word beforehand, and I
                                will
                                gather the gods to witness our pledge. Why fear when it is certain? Prepare yourself,
                                and
                                dispel
                                all delay: Jason will be for ever in your debt, take you to himself in sacred marriage,
                                and
                                through the cities of Pelasgian Greece, the crowds of women will glorify you as his
                                saviour.
                            </p>
                            <p>Carried by the winds, shall I leave my native country, my sister, my brother, my father,

                                my
                                gods? Well then, my father is barbarous, and my country is savage, and my brother is
                                still a
                                child: my sister&apos;s prayers are for me, and the greatest god is within! I will not
                                be
                                leaving greatness behind, but pursuing greatness: honour as a saviour of these Achaean
                                people,
                                familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here, the
                                culture
                                and arts of those places, and the man, the son of Aeson, for whom I would barter those
                                things
                                that the wide world owns, joined to whom I will be called fortunate, dear to the gods,
                                and
                                my

                            <p>What of the stories of mountains that clash together in mid-ocean, and Charybdis the bane
                                of
                                sailors, now sucking in, now spewing out the sea, and rapacious dog-headed Scylla,
                                yelping

                                the Sicilian deeps? Well, holding what I love, clinging to Jason&apos;s breast, I shall
                                be
                                carried over the wide seas: in his arms, I will fear nothing, or if I am afraid, I will
                                only
                                be
                                afraid for him.</p>
                            <p>But do you call that marriage, Medea, and clothe your fault with fair names? Consider
                                instead,
                                how great a sin you are near to, and while you can, shun the crime!</q>She spoke, and in

                                of her eyes, were rectitude, piety, modesty: and now, Cupid, defeated, was turning away.

                            <p>She went to the ancient altars of Hecate, daughter of the Titan Perses, that the shadowy

                                conceals, in the remote forest. And now she was strong and her passion, now conquered,

                                ebbed, when she saw the son of Aeson and the flame, that was dead, relit. Her cheeks
                                flushed,
                                and then her whole face became pallid. Just as a tiny spark that lies buried under the

                                takes life from a breath of air, and grows and, living, regains its previous strength,

                                for loving him. She gazed at him, and fixed her eyes on him as if she had never looked

                                and the teeth, freshly sown,produced new bodies. As an embryo takes on human form in the

                                created with them. The Pelasgians&apos; faces fell in fear, and their courage failed

                                hero. She also,who had rendered him safe, was afraid. When she saw the solitary youth

                                by so many enemies, she grewpale, and sat there, suddenly cold and bloodless. And in

                                the

                                called on her secret arts.

                                    <p>He threw a boulder into the midst of his enemies, and this turned their attack,

                                        fell
                                        as
                                        in civil war. The Achaeans cheered, andclung to the victor, and hugged him in

                                        embraces. You also, princess among the Barbarians, longed tohold the victorious

                                        but
                                        modesty prevented it. Still, you might have held him, but concern for

                                        stopped you from doing so. What you might fittingly do you did, rejoicing
                                        silently,
                                        givingthanks, for your incantations, and the gods who inspired them.

                                down on Thessalian Tempe farbelow, and sent the dragons to certain places that she knew.
                                She
                                considered those herbs that grow on MountOssa, those of Mount Pelion, Othrys and Pindus,
                                and
                                higher Olympus, and of those that pleased her, pluckedsome by the roots, and cut others,
                                with a
                                curved pruning-knife of bronze. Many she chose, as well, from thebanks of the Apidanus.
                                Many
                                she
                                chose, as well, from the Amphrysus. Nor did she omit the Enipeus. Peneus,and
                                Spercheus&apos;s
                                waters gave something, and the reedy shores of Boebe. And at Anthedon, by Euboea, she
                                pickeda
                                plant of long life, not yet famous for the change it made in Glaucus&apos;s body.</p>

                            <p>Then she returned, after nine days and nine nights surveying all the lands she had
                                crossed,
                                from
                                her chariot,drawn by the winged dragons. The dragons had only smelt the herbs, yet they
                                shed
                                their skins of many years.Reaching her door and threshold, she stopped on the outside,
                                and
                                under
                                the open sky, avoiding contact withany man, she set up two altars of turf, one on the
                                right
                                to
                                Hecate, one on the left to Youth. She wreathedthem with sacred boughs from the wildwood,
                                then
                                dug two trenches near by in the earth, and performed thesacrifice, plunging her knife
                                into
                                the
                                throat of a black-fleeced sheep, and drenching the wide ditches withblood. She poured
                                over
                                it
                                cups of pure honey, and again she poured over it cups of warm milk, uttering wordsas she
                                did
                                so,
                                calling on the spirits of the earth, and begging the shadowy king and his stolen bride,
                                notto be
                                too quick to steal life from the old man&apos;s limbs.</p>
                            <p>When she had appeased the gods by prayer and murmured a while, she ordered Aeson&apos;s
                                exhausted
                                body to becarried into the air, and freeing him to deep sleep with her spells, she
                                stretched
                                him
                                out like a corpse ona bed of herbs. She ordered Jason, his son, to go far off, and the
                                attendants to go far off, and warned themto keep profane eyes away from the mysteries.
                                They
                                went
                                as she had ordered. Medea, with streaming hair,circled the burning altars, like a
                                Bacchante,
                                and
                                dipping many-branched torches into the black ditchesfilled with blood, she lit them,
                                once
                                they
                                were darkened, at the twin altars. Three times with fire, threetimes with water, three
                                times
                                with sulphur, she purified the old man.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile a potent mixture is heating in a bronze cauldron set on the flames, bubbling,
                                and
                                seething, whitewith turbulent froth. She boils there, roots dug from a Thessalian
                                valley,
                                seeds,
                                flowerheads, and darkjuices. She throws in precious stones searched for in the distant
                                east,
                                and
                                sands that the ebbing tide ofocean washes. She adds hoar-frost collected by night under
                                the
                                moon, the wings and flesh of a vilescreech-owl, and the slavering foam of a sacrificed
                                were-wolf, that can change its savage features to thoseof a man. She does not forget the
                                scaly
                                skin of a thin Cinyphian water-snake, the liver of a long-livedstag, the eggs and the
                                head
                                of a
                                crow that has lived for nine human life-times.</p>
                            <p>With these, and a thousand other nameless things, the barbarian witch pursued her greater

                                mortalpurpose. She stirred it all with a long-dry branch of a fruitful olive, mixing the
                                depths
                                with the surface.Look! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron, first grew green
                                again,
                                then in a short time sproutedleaves, and was, suddenly, heavily loaded with olives. And
                                whenever
                                the flames caused froth to spatter fromthe hollow bronze, and warm drops to fall on the
                                earth,
                                the soil blossomed, and flowers and soft grassesgrew.</p>
                            <p>As soon as she saw this, Medea unsheathed a knife, and cut the old man&apos;s throat, and
                                letting
                                the old bloodout, filled the dry veins with the juice. When Aeson had absorbed it, part
                                through
                                his mouth, and partthrough the wound, the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished,
                                and
                                a
                                dark colour took its place. At astroke his leanness went, and his pallor and dullness of
                                mind.
                                The deep hollows were filled with roundedflesh, and his limbs expanded. Aeson marvelled,
                                recalling that this was his self of forty years ago.</p>

                                when she told them of one of her greatest gifts, the removal of Aeson&apos;s many years,
                                andlingered over it, hope was aroused in Pelias&apos;s daughters that similar magic arts

                            <p>They begged her, and told her to set a price however great. She was silent for a moment,

                                appeared tohesitate, keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of

                                dragged forward, his horns curving round his hollow temples. When thewitch had cut his

                                throat with her Thessalian knife, hardly staining the blade with blood, sheimmersed the

                                itslimbs, melted away its horns, and, with its horns, the years. A high-pitched bleating
                                came
                                from inside thevessel, and while they were wondering at the bleating, a lamb leapt out,

                                turned their eyesaway, and with averted faces, wounded him blindly with cruel hands.

                                Through thehigh sky, clockwise, she fled, over the shadowy slopes of Pelion,
                                Chiron&apos;s

                                and changed to a winged scarab beetle,lifted into the air, when the all-powerful sea

                                of Corythus, Paris, lay, buried under a little sand; and where Hecuba, changed to a

                            <p>She flew over Astypalaea, the city of Eurypylus, where the women of the island, of Cos,

                                horns whenthey abused Hercules, as he and his company departed: over Rhodes, beloved of

                                and the Telchines ofthe city of Ialysos on Rhodes, whose eyes corrupted everything they

                                on, so that Jupiter, disgustedwith them, sank them under his brother&apos;s ocean waves.
                                She
                                passed the walls of ancient Carthaea, on theisland of Ceos, where Alcidamas, as a

                                would
                                marvel, one day, that a peace-loving dove could springfrom the body of his daughter,

                            <p>Then she saw Lake Hyrie, and Cycnean Tempe, made famous suddenly by a swan. There
                                Phylius, at
                                the
                                boyCycnus&apos;s command, brought him birds and a fierce lion he had tamed. Ordered to

                                a wild bull as well,he did overcome him, but angry that his love was rejected so often,
                                he
                                refused to grant this last gift of abull, when asked. Cycnus, angered, said<q>You will
                                    wish
                                    you

                                he
                                beat
                                through the air on white wings, though his mother, Hyrie, notknowing he was safe, pined
                                away
                                with weeping, and became the lake that carries her name.</p>
                            <p>Near there was the city of Pleuron, where Combe the daughter of Ophius, on flickering
                                wings,
                                escaped death atthe hands of her sons, the Aetolian Curetes. And then Medea looked down
                                at
                                the
                                fields of Calaurea&apos;s isle,sacred to Leto, whose king and queen were also changed to
                                birds.
                                On her right was Cyllene, where Menephronlay with his mother, as though he were a wild
                                beast.
                                Further on she sees the Cephisus, the river-godlamenting his grandson&apos;s fate,
                                changed
                                by
                                Apollo into a lumbering seal, and the home of Eumelus, mourninghis son Botres, reborn as
                                a
                                bird,
                                the bee-eater, in the air.</p>
                            <p>At last, the dragon&apos;s wings brought her to Corinth, the ancient Ephyre, and its
                                Pirenian
                                spring. Here,tradition says, that in earliest times, human bodies sprang from fungi,
                                swollen
                                by
                                rain. After Jason&apos;s newbride Glauce had been consumed by the fires of vengeful
                                Colchian
                                witchcraft and both the Isthmus&apos;s gulfs hadwitnessed flame consuming the
                                king&apos;s
                                palace, Medea impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their sons.Then, after
                                performing
                                this
                                evil act, she fled from Jason&apos;s wrath. Carried by her dragons that are born ofthe
                                Titans,
                                she reached Pallas&apos;s citadel of Athens. This once knew you Phene, the most
                                righteous,
                                and
                                youold Periphas, both flying in the air, as birds, the eagle and the osprey: and
                                Alcyone,
                                granddaughter ofPolypemon, resting on strange new wings. It was Aegeus who gave Medea
                                sanctuary
                                there, damned thereafter bythat one action: and not content with taking her in, he even
                                entered
                                into a contract of marriage with her.

                            <p>Now Theseus came to Athens, Aegeus&apos;s son, but as yet unknown to him. He, by his
                                courage,
                                had
                                brought peace tothe Isthmus between the two gulfs. Medea, seeking his destruction,
                                prepared
                                a
                                mixture of poisonous aconite,she had brought with her from the coast of Scythia. This
                                poison
                                is
                                said to have dripped from the teeth ofCerberus, the Echidnean dog. There is a dark

                                with a
                                gaping mouth, and a path into the depths, upwhich Hercules, hero of Tiryns, dragged the
                                dog,
                                tied with steel chains, resisting and twisting its eyesaway from the daylight and the
                                shining
                                rays. Cerberus, provoked to a rabid frenzy, filled all the air withhis simultaneous
                                three-headed
                                howling, and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam. These aresupposed to

                                congealed and found food to multiply, gaining harmful strength from the rich soil.

                                    offered
                                    the poison to his son,as if he were a stranger. Theseus, unwittingly, had taken the

                                    he
